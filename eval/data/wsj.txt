My food cravings came back at first with a whimper, then with a bang. I noticed them about
three weeks after I took my last dose of a blockbuster medicine that helped me lose 40 pounds
with shocking ease.

During the five months that I took Mounjaro, I had experienced what felt like freedom. My
usual internal Greek chorus of a thousand voices, always telling me to eat, had been silent.
French fries, doughnuts and Frosted Flakes no longer called to me. Then, I stopped taking the
drug, a common choice for those using medicines like Mounjaro or Ozempic to lose weight.

Cost was a primary factor; I was paying $1,000 a month myself because most insurance
generally covers the drugs only for their primary use, combating diabetes. And despite the
weight loss, I felt ambivalent about the idea of relying on the pharmaceutical help for life, as
the drug makers recommend.

Then came the challenges of the next four months: a roulette wheel of binges, diets, exercise
regimens and mental and emotional battles with myself over will power, self-image and
motivation. It was remarkably like the struggles of overeating without taking a wonder drug
first, though with one important difference: That wonder drug had given me the gift of a 40-
pound head start, to either seize upon or squander.

In my case, there was a surprise revelation to process as well. After I published an essay in The
Wall Street Journal in January about my weight-loss experience, my mother disclosed to me
that she had been taking Ozempic, then Mounjaro, herself for more than a year. She lost just
about as much weight as I did, but as the milestone of her 80th birthday approached, she
sought to lose more—“I wanted to feel well,” she told me—so she opted to raise her dose,
despite the daily bouts of nausea and gastric discomfort that followed.

She recounted for me her own experience with a lifetime of battling obesity, starting from her
senior year in high school when she lost 15 pounds for graduation photos. Over the decades,
she turned to one crash diet after another and seesawed in weight more than a dozen times. In
her later years, she has endured almost constant pain from a variety of conditions, all made
worse by her weight. 

Lately, she has also been racked with guilt over feelings of having passed
such issues and struggles along to me, whether by nature or nurture. “I should have protected
you from that,” she said.

As we talked, we bonded over the difficult duality of being overweight or obese: Often, you
wish that you didn’t care and pledge that you can love yourself as you are. But then you start
to wonder: Could I change?

Something like that has motivated the millions taking Mounjaro, Ozempic and similar drugs
purely for weight loss. As the drugs’ popularity has surged, a number of clinical studies have
shown that those who stop taking them can regain the lost pounds at a rapid clip. That has led
drug manufacturers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to recommend that patients stay on the
medicines, perhaps for life. But most people are quitting: A recent analysis of thousands of
insurance claims found that only a third of individuals who started such drugs for weightloss were still taking them after a year.

Some people do get sustained benefits. In a study by Epic Research, more than half of
participants either maintained their weight, or had lost more, a year after stopping the
medicines; one in five had even doubled their weight loss. I was determined to be one of the
success stories and to figure out what to do to keep the drug’s effects from fading.
