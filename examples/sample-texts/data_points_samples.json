    "text": "Paid ChatGPT users can now upload files directly from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, interact with tables and charts using natural language, and customize charts for presentations. When users upload or import a data file, ChatGPT can now write and execute Python code to analyze or visualize that data on users’ behalf. These features may make it easier for those with limited coding skills to conduct in-depth analyses and let experts save time on routine data tasks."

    "text": "Chameleon can natively process both text and images together, allowing it to perform a wide range of mixed-modal tasks with impressive results. Meta’s researchers say the key is Chameleon’s fully token-based architecture (representing images as well as texts as tokens) and training on datasets that combine text with images. Chameleon outperforms many leading and specialized models (including GPT-4V and Gemini Pro) when answering questions about images, describing pictures, writing relevant text, and creating images from text prompts. "

Users can access the prompt generator directly on the Console or analyze the underlying prompt and architecture using a Google Colab notebook. The generator addresses a common challenge for AI users: efficiently crafting effective (and often larger and more complex) prompts that yield high-quality results."

The latter is the institute’s first multimodal model, capable of converting visual inputs into textual outputs. Both models are Apache 2.0 open-source, multilingual, and perform on par with Gemma 7B and better than Llama 3 8B according to benchmarks and HuggingFace leaderboards."
