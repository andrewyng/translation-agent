[{"text": "Paid ChatGPT users can now upload files directly from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, interact with tables and charts using natural language, and customize charts for presentations. When users upload or import a data file, ChatGPT can now write and execute Python code to analyze or visualize that data on users\u2019 behalf. These features may make it easier for those with limited coding skills to conduct in-depth analyses and let experts save time on routine data tasks."}, {"text": "Reddit\u2019s vast forums will be used to power ChatGPT and other AI products. The collaboration will give Reddit new AI-powered features for its users and moderators, while OpenAI will advertise on Reddit. (Full terms were undisclosed.) OpenAI now has deals with global newspapers, software forums, and a wide variety of other publishers, giving it special access to timely and high-quality training material."}, {"text": "ZeroGPU is accessible through Hugging Face\u2019s Spaces platform, which already hosts over 300,000 AI demos. The shared Nvidia A100s can be used concurrently by multiple users or applications; unutilized capacity will be made available to others. HuggingFace\u2019s goal is to counter tech giants and closed models\u2019 centralization by making state-of-the-art AI technologies more accessible."}, {"text": "Chameleon can natively process both text and images together, allowing it to perform a wide range of mixed-modal tasks with impressive results. Meta\u2019s researchers say the key is Chameleon\u2019s fully token-based architecture (representing images as well as texts as tokens) and training on datasets that combine text with images. Chameleon outperforms many leading and specialized models (including GPT-4V and Gemini Pro) when answering questions about images, describing pictures, writing relevant text, and creating images from text prompts.\u00a0"}, {"text": "Google\u2019s AI-assisted, browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) offers now-familiar features like code completion, debugging tools, and a chat-assisted sidebar, all powered by Gemini. Whenever IDX modifies snippets or suggests new code, it also links back to the original source and its associated license, ensuring proper attribution. Although Google is entering a competitive market, IDX aims to attract developers by showcasing Gemini\u2019s AI advancements and integrating with the company\u2019s cloud services."}, {"text": "The tool aims to solve new users\u2019 \u201cblank page problem\u201d by providing a starting point for testing and iteration, incorporating best practices like chain of thought and separating data from instructions. Users can access the prompt generator directly on the Console or analyze the underlying prompt and architecture using a Google Colab notebook. The generator addresses a common challenge for AI users: efficiently crafting effective (and often larger and more complex) prompts that yield high-quality results."}, {"text": "ElevenLabs Reader: AI Audio is the billion-dollar AI voice cloning startup\u2019s first consumer app. The free app can read web pages, PDFs, and other documents aloud using a selection of 11 AI-generated voices.
