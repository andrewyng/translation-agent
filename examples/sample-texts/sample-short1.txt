Last week, I spoke about AI and regulation at the U.S. Capitol at an event that was attended by legislative and business leaders. I’m encouraged by the progress the open source community has made fending off regulations that would have stifled innovation. But opponents of open source are continuing to shift their arguments, with the latest worries centering on open source's impact on national security. I hope we’ll all keep protecting open source!

Based on my conversations with legislators, I’m encouraged by the progress the U.S. federal government has made getting a realistic grasp of AI’s risks. To be clear, guardrails are needed. But they should be applied to AI applications, not to general-purpose AI technology.
